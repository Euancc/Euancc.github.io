While I was in Indonesia I made friends with a local man there who gave people kite surfing lessons. One day when he didn’t have any customers he said that he would give me a lesson. After the lesson I asked him how much money did I owe him for the lesson and he said that he cannot charge me anything because it is against his religion to make money off friends. Where he lives it is very hard to make a living so I decided to give the equivalent he would normally charge as a gift. I feel as though this was the right decision to make because I valued the generosity of this man given that he has come from a place that has a considerably worse economy than I do.</p>

<h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>

<p>All of my immediate family are fair and honest people. This has influenced me greatly to become the person I am today.</p>

<h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>

<p>Having a strong sense of curiosity helps me learn because it breaks down the barrier of not knowing or being able to do something. It allows me to see the unknown as potential for me to learn rather than something that will stop me from reaching my potential.</p>

<h3>Your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>

<p>My experience in coding and IT in general is quite limited and my previous career path does not have any hard skills that I can transfer to my learning journey. This may slow my learning.</p>

<h3> an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>

<p>While working as a team, The foreman would sometimes stop communicating positively with the group and only criticize what others were doing no, even if someone was working hard and doing a good job. This wouldn't be the case all the time but when it was, the morale would drop drastically. After putting up with it for a while I told my supervisor what was happening and the supervisor then had a conversation about it with the foreman. After that the foreman started speaking to everyone respectfully.Reflecting on this, I would have told the supervisor sooner. Putting up with someone being disrespectful lets them think it's ok.</p>
