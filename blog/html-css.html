  <h1 id="zoom" class="heading-color">The difference between ids an classes in HTML and CSS and when to use them</h1>
  <p>A web page is broken up into differnt sections such as headings, paragraphs, footers and many more sections which we call elements. If I wanted to make a heading on a page steelblue then I can make a rule on CSS that makes all of the headings steelblue. That is fine if you only have one heading but if you have multiple headings and you want to make a differnt heading <em>darkgoldenrod</em> then you would have to make a class of the color <em>darkgoldenrod</em> and apply that class to the specific heading. You can then apply that class to any other elements on your page that you want to turn <em>darkgoldenrod</em>. You can do the same thing with an id except that you can only us the id rule to apply to one element. You can have multiple ids but each has to have a different name and be applied individually to an element. With an id you can create a link to somewhere else on the web page so it takes you directly there without having to scroll and find it, which is something that you cannot do with a class.

  <p>And here I used a different class that I set up for the tantalising <em>darkgoldenrod</em></p>

  <p>Here you can see that I created an id of where the link will take you at the top of the page, and also the link anchored in the text in below</p>
  <p><a href="#zoom">Zoom me back to the top, I want to read it again</a></p>
