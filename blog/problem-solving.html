        <h3>When I was blocked</h3>
        <p>During my study I came across a block that was frustrating me, so I left my computer and went for a walk around a local park. After I came back refreshed, I realised that the code that I had written for the previous exercise was incorrect, which was inherintly failing the code. I then had to backtrack and correct everything that I had done wrong. This was about the only thing I could do at that stage. I felt a bit silly for not checking my previous code properly but I learned a valueble lesson which is to always check your code is passing before moving on!.</p>

        <h3>When it went well</h3>
        <p>When I was doing the Concat my array challenge, I was asked to use a JavaScript method that I had never used before. I Jumped on the Google and started looking at explanations and examples of how to use this method. I was lucky enough to find some good sources that gave me some insight on how to use the .join() method and I completed the challenge within the suggested timeframe. I learned that there are a lot of free resources on the google which can be helpful.</p>

        <p><strong>Pseudocode</strong> is hard to spell but It comes in handy especially when I am trying out new things or a variation of code that I have written. I will use Pseudocode to differenciate between the two.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Trying something</strong> is usually the first thing I do when my code is not passing. I will look at the code and if something doesn't look right then I will try doing something else.</p> 
        <p><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> will quite often take me by suprise. Sometimes the solution lies within the question.</p>
        <p><strong>Reading error messages</strong> will pin point where I have gone wrong but sometimes I don't have any idea of what I am looking at.</p>
        <p><strong>Console.logging</strong> is something that I use most of the time while doing the test exercises</p>
        <p><strong>Googling</strong>the problem will usually be the second thing that I do when I come across a problem</p>
        <p><strong>Asking peers for help</strong> I find is a rewarding way of getting a solution because I know that they have gone through the same problem as me.</p>
        <p><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> is what I do If I'm really stuck on something and I don't know what else to do but they will most of the time provide a lot of insight as to what to do and why.</p>
        <p><strong>Improving my process with reflection</strong> Is also very satisfying because at the time the problem seems so big but afterwards I can see how it works and how I can make my solution better.</p>
