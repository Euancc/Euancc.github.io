      <h1>Foundations reflection</h1>

      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
    <P>I like to try and learn things on my and own without help</P>
    <p>I can get frustrated when I can't figure something out</p>
    <p>I don't mind asking people for help</p>

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    </h2>
    <p>Values are important because they will help guide you when there is a tough decision to make</p>
    <p>Empathy is important because it is important to understand that other people have emotions and the way you behave towards them effects that</p>
    <p>Self-awareness is important because you don't want to come across the wrong way when you are expressing yourself to someone</p>

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    </h2>
    <p>That there are multiple different emotional elements that effect someones learning</p>

    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p>Describing some of the principles we learnt about ie: putting them into my own words</p>

    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course</h2>
    <p>Because employers want to hire people with core skills, and it will also help us get through bootcamp</p>

    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
    <p>No, coming from an industy where core skills don't seem to be focused on, I am glad to see that Dev-Academy puts a high value on them
