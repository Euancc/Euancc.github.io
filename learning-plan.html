      <h1>Learning plan</h1>
      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

      <p>To work a job that I can do partly or fully remotely that pays well.</p>
      
      <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      
      <p>My strengths would be that I am persistent and I don’t give up easily and my limitations would be that I hold off from asking for help for too long.</p>
      
      <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      
      <p>Time management and Creativity</p>
      
      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
      
       <h3>1. An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
        <h3>2. What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</h3>
       
     <p>A1. I will seek to communicate positively with all of my teammates and anyone else who I encounter on my journey at devacademy.</p>
      
      <p>A2. If it comes to a point where things are getting to me then I will tell my peers and facilitators so they know what is going on. During my spare time I will</p>
      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p>Make a checklist of thing to do for when I get stuck so that I don't put myself in a loop of ,aking the same error</p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>To give me clear instuctions of what is expected from me and to provide guidance when I need it</p>

  
      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>

      <p>I cannot foresee any block-out times but if something comes up I will inform my facilitators</p>

      <h1>Bootcamp learning plan</h1>
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>I want to get a job coding so that I gain enough skills to choose my next job that has the working conditions and environment that I desire. My long term goal is to work a job that has flexible working hours and the possibility to work remotely. I don't have a particular realm of development in mind at this stage.</p>

      <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>I think going through foundations has re assured the views I had on my strenghts. Throughout my previous career I have always worked in a team and get along with other people which has helped me get through foundations. I think a limitation will be not having much IT experience behind me.</p>

      <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p>Having always worked in trades and construction I am used to working outside and with my hands. Sitting in front of a computer for long periods of a time is challenging for me.</p>

      <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>I my last jobs I haven't had a lot of experience with giving and receiving feedback, it was more a culture of learning how to do it yourself. I think constantly getting feedback in a constructive way is a great way to develop your skills.</p>

      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>To deliver guidance when I am stuck on a problem and be patient if I am struggling to understand concepts.</p>

      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>I will seek help on the group chat threads on discord but if I need further guidance  I will reach out to one of the facilitators. I will keep track of how long I am spending on a project and make adjustments on how I approach problems depending on how much time I have and how it might affect my team mates</p>
